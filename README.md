This is a Spring Boot project that involves a Medical Test Center. The test center allows new tests to be ordered for various medical tests via a REST API. Users may also retreive that status of those tests via the API. Internally the program processes the tests and provides result for the tests. It also manages the test kit inventory required to run the various tests. When inventory runs low it restocks supplies.
